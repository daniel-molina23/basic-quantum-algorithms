# Basic Quantum Algorithms
This is a folder with notes and code for each of the basic quantum algorithms using common python libraries


## Requirements:
- install Anaconda since it is recommended for interacting with Qiskit library
- it is recommended to make virtual environments to cleanly seperate Qiskit from other applications (easy way is with Anaconda -> `conda create -n ENV_NAME python=3`, then `conda activate ENV_NAME`)
- install qiskit with `pip install qiskit` or `pip install qiskit[visualization]` (with exta visualization support)
